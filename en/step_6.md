## Challenge: Create a multi-colour picture

At the moment your pixel art pictures are mono-tone i.e. they only use 1 colour.

Can you create and then encode a pixel art image which has more than 1 colour.

When you encoded a mono-tone image you only needed **2** columns (X & Y), for multi-colour pictures you will need **3**.
