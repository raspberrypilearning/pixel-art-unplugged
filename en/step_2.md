## Pixels

Computer screens are divided up into a grid of very small dots called pixels (picture elements), by zooming in on pictures you can see the pixels.

DESIGN - a suitable picture and a zoomed in section showing the pixels.

These images show how you can use pixels to make art.

Computers represent everything, even pictures, with numbers. This means that when you design a picture for the computer, you need to make turn the pixels into numbers. 

In this picture you can see how each square on the grid corresponds to a coordinate for each row.

The grid numbering starts from (0,0) at the top left-hand corner of the grid, this is because computers use the same coordinates as old-fashioned televisions, which display images in horizontal lines from left to right and top to bottom.

Decode this image by colouring in the right coordinates. You can use whichever colour you like. What image do you see? 

DESIGN - Same as this, but including 0-10 labels for X and Y (same as the above image.)
