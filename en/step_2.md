## Pixels

Computer screens, and the pictures they show, are divided up into grids of very small dots called pixels (picture elements). When you zoom in on a picture, you can see its pixels.

DESIGN - a suitable picture and a zoomed in section showing the pixels.

These images show how you can use pixels to make art.

Computers represent everything, even pictures, with numbers. This means that when you design a picture for a computer, you need to turn the picture's pixels into numbers. 

Here you can see how each square on the grid corresponds to a coordinate for each row.

The grid numbering starts at (0, 0) in the top left-hand corner of the grid. This is because computers use the same (x, y)coordinates as old-fashioned televisions, which display images in horizontal lines from left to right, starting at the top and moving downwards.

Decode this image by colouring in the right coordinates. You can use whichever colour you like. What does the image show? 

DESIGN - Same as this, but including 0-10 labels for X and Y (same as the above image.)
